This work focuses on the autonomous drone to drone communication and coordination. An optimal UAV routing protocol using IEEE 802.11p is formalized. The information transfer between drones is simulated using the NS3 simulator, and the transfer metrics are optimized. Coordination among the drones is achieved by efficient communication and real-time operation. Object Detection Image processing techniques like human detection are integrated with the UAV mission to achieve the aid of UAVs in several practical applications. Mission planning is implemented locally using application transfer protocol with the aid of the Mission Planner simulator. This autonomous operation of drones with real-time coordination is employable in surveying, combat, search and rescue, entertainment and many other problems.
