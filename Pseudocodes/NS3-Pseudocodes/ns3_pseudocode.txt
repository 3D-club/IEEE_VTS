The NS3 simulation was set-up with two nodes installed
with WIFI and PHY channels, and each of them were assigned an initial position
with a random 3-dimensional mobility model(Gauss-Markov Model). The
transmission power was set to a range of 8 - 33dBm. Additionally, Nakagami Loss
Model was implemented to simulate a realistic environment.



The Nakagami-m
fast fading model takes into consideration the multipath fading resulting in
variations of signal strength.



Further, WAVE helper was installed into the nodes
along with QoS MAC helper. The WAVE helper's remote station manager has been
set to Constant Rate WIFI Manager with a OFDM rate of 6Mbps and a bandwidth of
10Mhz. The nodes were finally configured with trace callback
functions so that when the packets are either received or dropped, we would be
able to get subsequent information.



A function was defined to create packets in the CCH
channel with appropriate transmission power levels, priority, and data rates.
The protocol type was set to WSMP and the destination node's MAC address was
taken from the NetDevice[1] . The packet's buffer is
loaded with the coordinates of the sender node and a custom tag with the
current timestamp is added to the packet. The SendX function[2] , which is scheduled using
the NS3 scheduler, is called to transmit the packet using the unicast mode
along with the required transmission information.



Now, the simulator is started and the other node receives the packets and
using the trace callback functions detailed information of the received packet
is gathered such as the buffer, noise, propagation and queueing delays. Tracing
systems such as Packet Capture and ASCII trace were used to get additional data
from the transmitted and received packets. To get a proper visual understanding
of the simulation NetAnim[3]  was utilised.
