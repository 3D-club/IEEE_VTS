Drone Navigation

Start
  Step 1: Get the destination (dlat,dlon) pair from the waypoint
  Step 2: Using the GPS, get the current location of the drone. Store it as (ilat,ilon)
  Step 3: Initialize the vehicle speeds vx, vy, vz as 0 each
  Step 4: Set up the region of interest and frame of reference
  Step 5: Measure the distance between the current location and the destination, and plan for     an optimal path. path = list((lat, long) to be followed
  Step 6: Navigating to the destination. traversed = list()
      loc = (ilat, ilon)
      for i in range(len(path)):
           traversed.append(path[i])
            if path[i] = (dlat,dlon):
                  drone.stop()
                  drone.hover()
                   Release_operation_execution_log
            else:
                  optimize((vx,vy,vz), path[i+1])
                  drone.navigate(next_point)
            end if
      end for
  Step 7: The final point is reached, and confirmation is sent to the client
