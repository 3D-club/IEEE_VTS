**About the Simulation**

The  communication  protocol  used  for  wireless  drone-drone communication  is  802.11p  Wireless  Access  in  Vehicular Environments   (WAVE).   WAVE   devices   communicate directly over a fixed radio channel called the Control Channel(CCH)    which    offers    a    huge    advantage    for    UAV communication than typical 802.11 protocols as it is the only  channel  to  which  all  the  nodes  are  connected  at  a frequency range of 5.885â€“5.895 GHz. The channel supports a  customwave  short  message  protocol  stack  (WSMP), prioritizing  messages  and  giving  direct  control  to  radio transmission parameters (like transmission power control and levels)  for  faster  and  efficient  communication.  The  other channels  (SCHs)  support  traditional  IPv6  stack  to  support information   exchange   over   the   internet   and   standard networks  and  applications.  The  supports  more  extended range (260m), multi ad-hoc networks with high quality of service  (QoS),  power  control,  high  accuracy  for  received signal  strength  indication  (RSSI),  all  of  which  have  been simulated and tested by using network simulator 3(NS3)
