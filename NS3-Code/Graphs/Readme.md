Here, terminal output(terminal.png) shows the delay in between packet sending and recieving, which is calculated using timestamp tags . 
Along with it the position (in metres) of survey drone as captured by payload drone at the time of packet sending is shown.
These results are captured for increasing distance (in metres) value.

The Wireshark.png file shows the wireshark result which we got by enabling the packet capture(pcap) . It shows the protocols used , packet size over network, source and destination Mac address ,radio information (like datarate, frequency)for each sent packet.
